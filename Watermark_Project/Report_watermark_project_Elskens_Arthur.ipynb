    "The core code which is being used is based on the RGBA model for which A stands for Alpha and represents the transparency of a pixel in front of the white color, a value of 0 is white while a value of 255 is associated with the true color and opacity of the given pixel.\n",

This adaptation takes place only if the compared pixel of the watermark image has a value strictly bigger than 0.\n",
    "The “**apply_watermark(...)**” function, as its name indicates, applies the given watermark to the image with an adjustable parameter representing the wanted writings’ transparency. The “**remove_watermark(...)**” function, removes the applied watermark at the same location. Both of these functions allow to save the resulting image."

The combination of two letters for each axis will do the trick:\n",
